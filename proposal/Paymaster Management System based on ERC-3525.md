# Paymaster Management System based on ERC-3525

## ****Project Abstract****

> In 3-5 sentences what problem are you trying to solve? (The project abstract may be used for for the winners announcement.)

Build an open source and permissionless paymaster framework including smart contract and dApp based on ERC-3525. Leveraging the Slot ability of ERC-3525 to manage multiple paymasters within a single smart contract, avoid contract amount explosion, and reduce gas fees.  One can run paymaster management services by using this framework, providing customizable payment strategies, without deploy a separate smart contract for each paymaster.

## ****Objectives****

> What are you hoping to accomplish with this grant? How do you define and measure success for this project?

We plan to use this grant to accomplish the following tasks: design system architecture, develop smart contract reference implementation, and develop frontend App prototype.

Based on the above achievements, develop a running system for managing multiple Paymasters and promote community adoption.

## ****Outcomes****

> How does this project benefit the greater Ethereum ecosystem?

Lower the entry barrier for paymasters, reduce the cost of building a paymaster management system, so that more developers and paymasters can participate in the services of ERC-4337.

## ****Grant Scope****

> What are you going to research? What is the expected output?

Design and explanation documents, smart contracts, Frontend dApp, Subgraphs of theGraph.

## ****Project Team****

> How many people are working on this project?

## ****Methodology****

> How do you plan to achieve your research objectives?

1. System design: The core architecture is to manage paymaster information using SLOT of ERC-3525
2. Smart contract development: Develop ERC-3525 contract base on the existing BasePaymaster contract
3. Frontend app development: Design and develop UI for the paymaster management functions
4. Deployment of smart contracts and dApps on Goerli testnet and Ethereum Mainnet, Github pages, etc.

## ****Timeline****

> Please include a brief explanation on the milestones/roadmap, along with expected deliverables. Also outline how the funds will be used for the research project and or members of the team.

4 Months

First month: System design

Second and third months: Smart contract development, frontend app development

Fourth month: Deployment of dApps, writing introductory articles, introducing the result to the community
