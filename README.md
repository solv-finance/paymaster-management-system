# Paymaster Management System based on ERC-3525

## ****Project Abstract****

Build an open source and permissionless paymaster framework including smart contract and dApp based on ERC-3525. Leveraging the Slot ability of ERC-3525 to manage multiple paymasters within a single smart contract, avoid contract amount explosion, and reduce gas fees.  One can run paymaster management services by using this framework, providing customizable payment strategies, without deploy a separate smart contract for each paymaster.

## ****Objectives****

We plan to use this grant to accomplish the following tasks: design system architecture, develop smart contract reference implementation, and develop frontend App prototype.

Based on the above achievements, develop a running system for managing multiple Paymasters and promote community adoption.

## ****Outcomes****

Lower the entry barrier for paymasters, reduce the cost of building a paymaster management system, so that more developers and paymasters can participate in the services of ERC-4337.
